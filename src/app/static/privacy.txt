PRIVACY POLICY

We collect anonymous usage data from queries issued to the API and Assistant
integration, including but not limited to:

* Query text
* Query parameters (stop, route, etc)
* Metadata (query time, etc)

The data are used only to debug and improve the service.

In addition, requests to the service are handled by
https://transport.opendata.ch, who probably have their own privacy policy
somewhere.
