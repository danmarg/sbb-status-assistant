"SWISS TRANSIT" ASSISTANT ACTION PRIVACY POLICY

The "Swiss Transit" Assistant action collects the following data when you use
the action:

* Query text: What you input to the action (for example, "What are the next
  trains from Zurich HB?")
* Query metadata: Time the query was issued

We do not have access to personally identifiable data such as your IP address,
email address, or name.

Logged data are used only to improve the service; in particular, queries are
used to improve both the query parser and data sources (i.e. SBB stops, routes,
etc).

The live SBB transit data are provided by the API at
https://transport.opendata.ch. Opendata.ch do not themselves provide a privacy
policy, however, their data source is Search.ch, whose API terms of use are
here: https://timetable.search.ch/api/terms. Opendata.ch and Search.ch have
access to a limited subset of the data described above; specifically, query
parameters (requested stops, destinations, routes, and times), but not raw
query text.

Finally, the Google Assistant integration is, of course, provided by Google,
whose privacy policy is here: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.
